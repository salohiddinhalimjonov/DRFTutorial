Response -REST framework supports HTTP content negotiation by providing a Response class which allows you to return content that can be rendered 
into multiple content types, depending on the client request.
Response(data, status=None, template_name=None, headers=None, content_type=None)
data: The serialized, unrendered data for the response.
status: A status code for the response. Defaults to 200. See also status codes.
template_name: A template name to use if HTMLRenderer is selected.
headers: A dictionary of HTTP headers to use in the response.
content_type: The content type of the response. Typically, this will be set automatically by the renderer as determined by content negotiation,
but there may be some cases where you need to specify the content type explicitly.
