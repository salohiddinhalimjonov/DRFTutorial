request.data = request.POST, request.PUT, request.PATCH, request.FILES

request.query_params = request.GET

request.user -- if user is autheenticated, request.user is an instance of django.contrib.auth.models.User, 
if not authenticated it is instance of django.contrib.auth.models.AnonymousUser

request.auth -- if token authentication is used request.auth will be equal to token, in other authentication 
types it will be equal to None

request.method - returns uppercased string representation of the request's HTTP method(PUT, PATCH, GET,POST,DELETE)

request.content_type - returns a string object representing the media type of the HTTP request's body, or an empty string if no media type was provided.
You won't typically need to directly access the request's content type, as you'll normally rely on REST framework's default request parsing behavior.
If you do need to access the content type of the request you should use the .content_type property in preference to using request.META.get('HTTP_CONTENT_TYPE'), 
as it provides transparent support for browser-based non-form content.

request.stream

request.session -- Django provides full support for anonymous sessions. The session framework lets you store and retrieve arbitrary data on a per-site-visitor basis.
 It stores data on the server side and abstracts the sending and receiving of cookies. Cookies contain a session ID – 
 not the data itself (unless you’re using the cookie based backend).
 To set and get the session in views, we can use request.session and can set multiple times too.
